# COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability

We study the **controllable** jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we focus on how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this work, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the [Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/3e25d1aff47964c8409fd5c8dc0438d7-Abstract-Conference.html), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios including:
1. Fluent suffix attacks (standard attack setting which append the adversarial prompt to the original malicious user query).
2. Paraphrase attack with and without sentiment steering (revising a user query adversarially with minimal paraphrasing).
3. Attack with left-right-coherence (inserting stealthy attacks in context with left-right-coherence).

## COLD-Attack

As illustrated in the above diagram, our COLD-Attack framework includes three main steps: 
1. **Energy function formulation**: specify energy functions properly to capture the attack constraints such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence.
2. **Langevin dynamics sampling**: run Langevin dynamics recursively for $N$ steps to obtain a good energy-based model governing the adversarial attack logits $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}^N$. 
3. **Decoding process**: leverage an LLM-guided decoding process to covert the continuous logit $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}^N$ into discrete text attacks $\mathbf{y}$.

## Jailbreaking Performance

### (Note: The study for the settings with chat templates and system prompts is crucial, and controllable jailbreaking in such settings needs further investigations)

We evaluate the performance of COLD-Attack on four popular white-box LLMs: Vicuna-7b-v1.5 (Vicuna), Llama-2-7b-Chat-hf (Llama2), Guanaco-7b (Guanaco), and Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2 (Mistral). In addition, we use the following three main evaluation metrics:
1. Attack Successful Rate (**ASR**): the percentage of instructions that elicit corresponding harmful outputs using the sub-string matching method.
2. GPT-4 based ASR (**ASR-G**): We develop a prompt template and utilize GPT-4 to assess whether a response accurately fulfills the malicious instruction. Based on our observations, ASR-G has shown a higher correlation with human annotations, providing a more reliable measure of attack effectiveness.
3. Perplexity (**PPL**): We use PPL to evaluate the fluency of the generated prompts and use Vicuna-7b to do the PPL calculation.

To ensure the generated adversarial prompts meet specific criteria, we apply controls over various features, including sentiment and vocabulary. We evaluate how well these controls work using a metric called **Succ**, which represents the percentage of samples that successfully adhere to our set requirements. Additionally, a range of NLP-related evaluation metrics including **BERTScore**, **BLEU**, and **ROUGE** are applied to evaluate the quality of generated controllable attacks.
